Extension 'form' Fluid
template overrides
-----------------------------------
Feel free to add/copy the 'Layouts', 'Partials' and 'Templates' directories
from the core extension 'form' into this directory. Any existing file will be used
to override the default Layout/Partial/Template automatically. You may
ignore/delete the 'Compatibility' files/directories as these would be used
in compatibility mode, which we're not using per default.
