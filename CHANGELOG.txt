- Automatically initialize lightbox w/ fancybox "media" helper, if link has been assigned .lightbox-media or .fancybox-media
- Configurable, css-only hamburger icon (.hamburger-icon) in common styles.
- Default styles for indexed_search searchbox vs. result list display (hide unwanted contents in each).
- 404 and 401 error pages may now be optionally defined on a per-domain/host basis (see error404Uid parameter in extension configuration).

### Fixed
- Change "boolval" type casting in PostInstallFileHandler to intval() in order to support older PHP versions.
- Revert c4dd7bee4c5: Wrong configuration led to broken JS (p.e. linkTo_UnCryptMailTo was not available anymore).

### Updated

- Insert correct remote URL to templateboostrap in README.
